Comfy and cute!,I absolutely love this picc cover! The material is incredibly comfortable and the cover stays in place perfectly.

LOVE!,"First: The company is wonderful and customer support is superb! I ended up  needing to reorder my cover because I wasn't sure of the size and Emily and her staff made it so easy for me. 

Second: These PICC line sleeves are cute AND comfy. I've gotten several compliments on mine. The material is so soft which is important to me since everything else I've tried irritates my skin. 

Third: The design is so clever! The sleeve keeps the PICC line away from your skin and the seam of the sleeve faces out so it also doesn't  make contact with your skin. 

Try it. You won't be disappointed!",5,2016-10-27 13:56:20 UTC,shopify,ok,Jen Blalock,jblalock4@gmail.com,7991364103,picc-line-cover-1,,,,,"",

I would recommend this cover to anyone with a PICC or midline catheter.,"I currently have a midline catheter in my arm, not an actual PICC. The midline is very similar to a PICC, except that the line in my vein only goes as far as my armpit, and not all the way to my heart. I had been using PICC covers which I had from a prior PICC, but I found that due to the location of the midline insertion - which is in my elbow - the PICC cover did not cover my line well enough. The PICCPerfect cover works great. It allows me to fully cover the midline, keep the leads contained, and it looks like I am wearing an elbow wrap/support. It is also very comfortable to wear. I would recommend this cover to anyone with a PICC or midline catheter.",5,2017-07-24 16:58:09 UTC,shopify,ok,David Leeds,dave.leeds@gmail.com,7308932551,piccperfect,,,,,"",

PICC line cover (black) - overall very good,"First, the customer service is excellent. I contacted Mighty Well via Etsy to inquire if they had any plain black PICC covers, as I didn't see any listed and didn't see that they had a website during my initial search. They replied quickly, advised on sizing, and I ordered one. I live close so it was here within 2 days, which was great! Now, going into this I know the sizing would be a problem, as I'm a very petite adult who often straddles the line between a larger kids size and the smallest adult size. That was exactly the case here, I ordered the ""D"" size and it's a bit too long and a bit too large and slides down, so I don't wear it as much as I would like to. (I did wait to order so swelling after the procedure wouldn't be a factor, please make sure you take that into consideration as well!) The fabric and sewing are top quality; I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn't make me itch or cause a rash. That in itself is a miracle! My suggestion would be to provide a length measurement from top to  where it folds over and where the line openings are from the ends, I think it would help with making sizing decisions for those who are in between.

A little thing making a huge difference...,"Had a PICC line put in after a hospital stay to continue home IV antibiotics due to an infection.  PICC line was covered with white mesh and I was given some extra for home. It is stressful enough having to come to terms with 3 IV's per day for six weeks and all that entails let alone having to worry about the vulnerability of the PICC line and the tubing. I called every surgical supply store in my area and most didn't even know what a PICC line cover was let alone had any in stock. A quick google search later let me to many companies selling them on line. I found a review of Mighty Well and the story behind the company and said that's who I'm ordering from. Followed sizing instructions and measured my arm, placed order and cover was delivered within 72 hours way ahead of promised delivery. I watched the video of how to wear the cover and put it on. Just putting the cover on and securing the tubing made me feel better and so happy.  One less thing to worry about and I couldn't be more pleased with the product.

PICCPerfect 2.0 is Perfect,"I had a port for 3 years, until it became infected and I received my first PICC line.

I kept looking and came across the Mighty Well website and I immediately purchased two of the PICCPerfect 2.0. I ordered two XL covers and when they arrived I immediately put them on, realizing within a few hours that I had ordered the wrong size, it kept sliding down.

Fantastic product!,"This medication planner is absolutely fantastic! I have adapted it slightly so instead of dedicating each compartment to a day/time, I have dedicated each medication to its unique compartment. One small improvement that I wish could be implemente is elastic on the sides of the med case to hold longer items such as epipens and lancets. This would be a lot more convenient as my bulkier items such as glucose monitor, test strips, pulse ox and neuromodulator controller take up the majority of the elastic space, so a small change like this would drastically improve the amount of storage. I also observed that the second picture on the listing depicts the envelopes as having three compartments instead of one large compartment.

I love that I don't have to take the whole thing off to run an infusion. The only thing was that after about 8 days of wear, it became a little lose and would slid down to expose the dressing if I moved my arm around or wore a long sleeve shirt. I washed it today (as I had been wearing it for 10 days) and decided to put it in the dryer on regular heat to see if that would zap it back to its original shape. Sure enough it did the trick!

The Answer for Medication Woes,"I just received this wonderful Mighty MedPlanner yesterday in the mail.

I am a diabetic (type 2) and a breast cancer survivor. I take a multiple of pills, plus need to carry my diabetic's test kit and an inhaler. Add to that, alcohol, lances, bandages and an emergency snack in case of low blood sugar and you got a lot of stuff that I should carry around but just don't! Too many times we have been away from home and stop to eat but I don't have my test kit, or pills or just something.

Finally A Bag That Works With My Wheelchair!,"I love my Mighty Pack! Not gonna lie, I was super hesitant to buy this due to the price tag. Then my treatment changed and I started needing to be hooked up to an IV bag and tube feeds at the same time. 

This bag easily fits my tube feeding pump and bag. It also has enough space to put 1L of IV fluids in, along with a curlin pump. It’s made of some very high quality material as well, and sewn together expertly. I could easily see this bag lasting me years without falling apart,.

I am in a wheelchair full time so one of my biggest concerns was that this bag wouldn’t fit well on the back of my chair. This backpack has detachable straps, which makes it literally perfect for wheelchair users. I can put it on my wheelchair very securely, without any concern that it’s going to fall off, and it stays well above the ground or my power assist.

Before getting my Mighty Pack I used to leave the house with a backpack on my back, an undercarriage bag for my wheelchair, a large grey backpack for all my supplies, and another small bag for formula. Now I can fit everything I need for my medications in the mighty pack and my undercarriage bag just carries my documents.

I have but one “con” with this bag. On its own, prior to putting anything in the bag, it’s already kind of heavy. I haven’t weighed it yet but I’d say maybe 2-3lb. Part of this I think is due to the insulation and padding that they put into the biggest compartment for electronics, which I don’t use for electronics so it’s sort of a moot point for me.. I would love to see an option, in the future, to remove the padding from the bag if the person doesn’t expect to be using it. 

All in all, this bag has given me so much peace of mind. I now have my emergency meds near me any time I need them, leaving the house is just a matter of throwing my feeds in and rolling out.",5,2019-04-20 20:10:53 UTC,web,not-yet,Bethany,bethanyharrup@gmail.com,1606536069154,medical-iv-infusion-backpack-for-patients,,,,174.193.152.231,"Indian Trail, North Carolina, United States",Tube feeding and daily infusions

"Amazing, but I want a different color.","I bought this backpack last February (2019). I was hating the stupid cheap bag my infusion company gave me, and no other options were working. So I spent the money to get this bag. I love the ability to throw my medications, IV supplies and pump in my bag and be able to safely, and efficiently, live my life. I have a history of destroying bags, that I carry every day, within 2-3 months. I need to carry lots of items for my health and in case of emergencies. I am impressed that my bag looks almost as good as it did the day I got it in the mail. The reason I couldn’t give this bag five stars is because, 1. I wish it was a different color than black, it shows lots of dirt and other things I get into, and 2. I wish the straps were about 2-3 inches longer.

It's easy to fold down and access my PICC whenever I'm doing infusions, they're easy to wash either by hand or with the rest of my clothes, and they look nice (I prefer to use the plain black or blue because I find they go well with everything I wear). 
PLEASE NOTE: They do stretch out - I have thin arms. I got size small at first, but they got a bit floppy after a few weeks, and now can only wear for a day or two before having to wash it (which shrinks it back up). I got two XS ones after that, and they were a bit tight at first, but since they stretched after a few days, they fit perfectly, and they'll never sag.
